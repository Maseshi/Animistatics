# Animistatics

Welcome to Animistatics - a latent diffusion model for weebs. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_girl, cafe, plants, coffee, lighting, steam, blue eyes, brown hair_** 

## Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run Animistatics:

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
import torch

repo_id = "Maseshi/Animistatics"
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(repo_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)

pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "girl, cafe, plants, coffee, lighting, steam, blue eyes, brown hair"
image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25).images[0]
image.save("girl.png")
```

## Examples

Below are some examples of images generated using this model:

**Anime Girl:**
